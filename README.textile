h1. About

Transform MAB-XML to JSON for Elasticsearch indexing with "Metafacture":https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-core/wiki used by the resources endpoint of http://lobid.org/.

This repo is going to substitue big parts of https://github.com/lobid/lodmill .
This will be the base for the new lobid.org/resources API 2.0.
The aim is to make things easier, i.e.:
- get rid of hadoop
- concentrating only on lobid-resources (and not also gnd, lobid-organisations etc.)
